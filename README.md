Waraxe Stats
============

A very rough statistics program for old (7th Edition) Warhammer. Currently contains only stats for shooting (wrote the code a while ago, but it looks like I'd started thinking about combat as well).

To Use
------

At the moment, open a repl, load all the files, then you should be able to create unit objects, with ranged-weapons to represent their equipment (no defaults provided as yet). Then the 'print-ranged-dist-for' function should give you a distribution of events which could occur from shooting with the firer at the targer.

That's all.

...For now.
